				<p>The Government will reverse its ban on oil and gas exploration, Minister for Resources Shane Jones has confirmed.</p>
			</b>
		</div>


		<p>Jones said New Zealand's natural gas reserves were declining and sustainable sources like wind, solar and hydro were too inconsistent.</p>


		<p>"Natural gas is critical to keeping our lights on and our economy running, especially during peak electricity demand and when generation dips because of more intermittent sources like wind, solar and hydro," Jones said today.</p>


		<p>Offshore petroleum exploration was banned in 2018, but Jones said that restriction would be removed.</p>


		<p>"When the exploration ban was introduced by the previous government in 2018, it not only halted the exploration needed to identify new sources, but it also shrank investment in further development of our known gas fields which sustain our current levels of use.</p>
